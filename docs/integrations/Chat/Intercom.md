# Intercom Chat Integration – Document360

Document360 supports integration with **Intercom**, a customer messaging platform that enables you to provide live chat support and engage with your users directly within your knowledge base.

This integration helps improve customer experience by allowing real-time communication and support access while browsing documentation.
